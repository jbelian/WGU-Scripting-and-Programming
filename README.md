# Scripting and Programming

This course is an introduction to object-oriented programming using C++ in Visual Studio. The goal of this program is to "migrate an existing student system to a new platform". The input data is a string array of students with their name, degree program, etc. The program creates a roster of student objects, manipulates those objects with function calls (which could be, for example, "remove from the roster the student with the ID of A1") , and outputs the results to the screen.
